## üëã About
I'm Rohit ‚Äî a cybersecurity student focused on **Network Security, firewalls, secure architectures, and banking fraud prevention research**. I build and break systems in controlled sandboxes (GNS3 / container labs) to understand how attackers operate and how defenders should respond. This GitHub is where I turn ideas into working artifacts: topologies, scripts, reports, and repeatable experiments.

> Current focus: **Proactive Fraud Prevention in Banking Systems**
